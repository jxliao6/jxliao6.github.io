**Abstract:**

In high-stakes domains, deep analytical processing of online videos is essential for decision-making and knowledge acquisition. However, individuals may lack sufficient cognitive resources and triggers to engage in such processes. To address this, we introduce DeepThinkingMap, a collaborative video mapping system with affordances designed to leverage peers’ thoughts and comments to promote reflective and critical thinking. The design supports collaborative mapping of video concepts and supports open deliberations of personal thoughts over concepts as "thinking nudges" to foster deeper thinking for themselves and others. Through two experimental studies, we investigated the potential of deeper thinking by accessing peers’ thoughts in standalone and collaborative information work respectively. Results illustrated that accessing peers’ comments enhances personal engagement in reflective and critical thinking, and reinforces their confidence in their correct beliefs toward the video topics. This work contributes to understanding the socio-technical-cognitive mechanism of thinking while accessing peer comments, and presents design implications for information and knowledge work.
