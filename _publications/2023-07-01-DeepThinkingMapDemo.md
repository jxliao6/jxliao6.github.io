**Abstract:**

The varying quality of information online has increased cognitive demands to process information beyond surface-level understanding, particularly in high-stakes domains. Cognitive and social heuristics, including availability bias and evaluation apprehension, may hinder reflective and critical thinking. To address this, we introduce social nudging, a non-coercive intervention that leverages peers' thoughts and commenting behaviors to encourage deep thinking. By seeing how peers conceptualize and reflect on information (e.g., healthcare videos), their insights can serve as a nudge, engaging individuals in active thinking and fostering in-depth thoughts. We present DeepThinkingMap, a collaborative interface for video watching that enables thought exchanging on a concept-mapping-akin workspace. Through two studies, we found that social nudging enhances the engagement of both reflective and critical thinking, and elevates users' attitude confidence. These studies contribute to understandings of the sociotechnical cognitive mechanisms and the design space of social nudging to support reflection and critical thinking of high-stakes information.
