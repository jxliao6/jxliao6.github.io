title: "Balancing Human Agency and AI Autonomy in Human-AI Idea Selection"

excerpt: 'Many generative AI systems are built for domain-specific knowledge work. These tasks often involve idea generation with verifiable, clearly defined outputs. The subjective nature of evaluating creative outputs, however, has traditionally involved final idea curation by humans. Extending this human-only idea selection process to human-AI teams has the potential to boost performance by leveraging AI capabilities, but how to best balance human agency and AI autonomy remains unclear. We used a technology probe, IdeaMap, with a chatroom and ideation map visualization to elicit feedback on desired AI features for convergent thinking (idea selection) in single and multi-party group brainstorming in a participatory design workshop (12 participants). We uncovered user perceptions on human agency and AI autonomy in human-AI teaming for convergent thinking, and discuss how to balance them with a situationally aware, flexible AI that responds to both explicit user feedback and observed user behaviors.'
