**Abstract:**

As access to educational video resources has been enhanced through search tools, recommender systems, and social channeling, users often encounter challenges in integrating diverse videos systematically, particularly when they possess a limited understanding of the topics at hand (e.g., novice learners). To address this challenge, we present ConceptCombo, a video navigating interface facilitating user explorations of unstructured video collections with conceptual structures and themes of social comments extracted from videos and visualized by the system. To help novices identify a series of quality videos to watch, ConceptCombo aims to deliver a structured overview of the video collection by systematically extracting a concept map from the video content, coupled with automatic summarization of user comments across the videos, as a treemap visualization. 
With ConceptCombo, novice users may adopt a synergistic approach to video exploration, underpinned by the semantic structure of the video content, social comments, and additional video metadata.
